       "'\\nWrite a summary of the following speech:\\nSpeech:\\nPeople across the country, involved in government, political, and social activities, are dedicating their time to make the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ (Developed India Resolution Journey) successful. Therefore, as a Member of Parliament, it was my responsibility to also contribute my time to this program. So, today, I have come here just as a Member of Parliament and your ‘sevak’, ready to participate in this program, much like you.\\n\\nIn our country, governments have come and gone, numerous schemes have been formulated, discussions have taken place, and big promises have been made. However, my experience and observations led me to believe that the most critical aspect that requires attention is ensuring that the government’s plans reach the intended beneficiaries without any hassles. If there is a ‘Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana’ (Prime Minister’s housing scheme), then those who are living in jhuggis and slums should get their houses. And he should not need to make rounds of the government offices for this purpose. The government should reach him. Since you have assigned this responsibility to me, about four crore families have got their ‘pucca’ houses. However, I have encountered cases where someone is left out of the government benefits. Therefore, I have decided to tour the country again, to listen to people’s experiences with government schemes, to understand whether they received the intended benefits, and to ensure that the programs are reaching everyone as planned without paying any bribes. We will get the real picture if we visit them again. Therefore, this ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ is, in a way, my own examination. I want to hear from you and the people across the country whether what I envisioned and the work I have been doing aligns with reality and whether it has reached those for whom it was meant.\\n\\nIt is crucial to check whether the work that was supposed to happen has indeed taken place. I recently met some individuals who utilized the Ayushman card to get treatment for serious illnesses. One person met with a severe accident, and after using the card, he could afford the necessary operation, and now he is recovering well. When I asked him, he said: “How could I afford this treatment? Now that there is the Ayushman card, I mustered courage and underwent an operation. Now I am perfectly fine.”  Such stories are blessings to me.\\n\\nThe bureaucrats, who prepare good schemes, expedite the paperwork and even allocate funds, also feel satisfied that 50 or 100 people who were supposed to get the funds have got it. The funds meant for a thousand villages have been released. But their job satisfaction peaks when they hear that their work has directly impacted someone’s life positively. When they see the tangible results of their efforts, their enthusiasm multiplies. They feel satisfied. Therefore, ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’ has had a positive impact on government officers. It has made them more enthusiastic about their work, especially when they witness the tangible benefits reaching the people. Officers now feel satisfied with their work, saying, “I made a good plan, I created a file, and the intended beneficiaries received the benefits.” When they find that the money has reached a poor widow under the Jeevan Jyoti scheme and it was a great help to her during her crisis, they realise that they have done a good job. When a government officer listens to such stories, he feels very satisfied.\\n\\nThere are very few who understand the power and impact of the ‘Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra’. When I hear people connected to bureaucratic circles talking about it, expressing their satisfaction, it resonates with me. I’ve heard stories where someone suddenly received 2 lakh rupees after the death of her husband, and a sister mentioned how the arrival of gas in her home transformed her lives. The most significant aspect is when someone says that the line between rich and poor has vanished. While the slogan ‘Garibi Hatao’ (Remove Poverty) is one thing, but the real change happens when a person says, “As soon as the gas stove came to my house, the distinction between poverty and affluence disappeared.\\n\\nTranslate the precise summary to French\\n'"

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo.

I would like to narr ate, how I \\nenjoyed every minute of my tenure enriched by the wonderful assoc iation from each one \\nof you, hailing from different walks of life, be it politics, sci ence and technology, \\nacademics, arts, literature, business, judiciary, administration, local bodies, farming, \\nhome makers, special children, media and above all from the youth and st udent \\ncommunity who are the future wealth of our country. During my intera ction at \\nRashtrapati Bhavan in Delhi and at every state and union territor y as well as through my \\nonline interactions, I have many unique experiences to share with you, which signify the \\nfollowing important messages: \\n \\n1. Accelerate development : Aspiration of the youth, \\n \\n2. Empower villages, \\n \\n3. Mobilize rural core competence for competitiveness, \\n \\n4.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth.

The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government.

That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs.

      "He starts by talking about the youth's aspirations and a question from a girl named Anukriti, which inspired him. Then he lists ten points: accelerating development, empowering villages, mobilizing rural competence, agricultural growth, overcoming problems, partnerships, courage in disasters, connectivity, national defense, and a youth movement for a developed India by 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should make sure the summary includes each of these points clearly. Also, I need to highlight his emphasis on the youth and their role in the future. The user might be looking for a concise yet comprehensive overview, so I should keep it structured but not too lengthy.\n",

He expresses his joy and fulfillment from working with people from all walks of life, including politicians, scientists, academics, artists, and youth. He highlights ten key messages from his experiences:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Accelerate Development: Aspiration of the youth** – Inspired by a question from a young girl, Anukriti, he emphasizes the need to strive for a developed India by 2020, driven by the aspirations of the youth.  \n",
      "2. **Empower Villages** – Focus on rural development to strengthen the backbone of the nation.  \n",

      "Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want a speech summarized. Let me look at the details. The speech starts with appreciating the question, calling it thoughtful. Then there's an assurance that her dream will be taken to the highest institution and that they'll work. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hmm, I need to make a concise summary. I should capture the appreciation, the assurance, and the commitment to take action. Maybe something like, \"The speaker appreciated the thoughtful question and assured that the dream would be taken to the highest national institution, promising to work on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, that's a bit long. Let me make it shorter. Perhaps, \"The speaker appreciated the thoughtful question and assured that her dream would be taken to the highest national institution and acted upon.\" Yeah, that sounds good. It includes all key points without being wordy.\n",

      "Alright, I need to help the user by summarizing the provided speech. Let me read through the speech first to understand the main points.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech starts by talking about the youth's desire for a developed India by 2020. It mentions over 15 lakh youth met and how their aspirations should guide contributions in any profession. That's the first key point about empowering the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, the speaker recalls a visit to Nagaland in 2002. They discuss meeting with tribal council members and seeing an empowered village with financial powers. They highlight the need for better connectivity to markets, which is important for village prosperity. This part is about village empowerment and connectivity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the speech shifts to the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology's PURA initiative. This involves 65 villages with 3 lakh people, providing physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity. It leads to economic benefits, job creation, and entrepreneurship. So, the third point is about the PURA model and its benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to condense these points into a concise summary. I'll start with the youth's aspirations, then move to village empowerment and connectivity, and finally the PURA model's impact. I should make sure the summary flows well and covers all main ideas without getting too detailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also ensure the summary is clear and easy to understand, avoiding any jargon. Let me structure it in a way that each paragraph addresses one main point, making it organized and readable.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech emphasizes the aspirations of India's youth to live in a prosperous, safe, and proud nation, reflecting their desire for development. It highlights the importance of empowering villages, citing the example of Nagaland's Khuza village, where an empowered village council with financial powers demonstrated the potential for transformation across India's 600,000 villages. The speech also discusses the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology's initiative, Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA), which connects 65 villages through physical, electronic, and knowledge connectivity, leading to economic growth, employment, and entrepreneurship. These examples underscore the need for connectivity and empowerment to drive progress in both rural and urban areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to summarize the given speech about employment generation and sustainable development. Let me read through it carefully.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech starts by talking about creating employment and entrepreneurs with the help of 1000 self-help groups. They've developed 200 acres of wasteland into cultivable land. The villagers are involved in activities like cultivating Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, generating power using biomass, food processing, and running marketing centers. This provides a sustainable economic model for the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, it mentions that over the past eight months, villages in Periyar PURA have worked with experts from JETRO (Japan External Trade Organisation) and Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women. They developed 55 lifestyle products that are internationally competitive, thanks to support from JETRO and feedback from exhibitions in Delhi and Tokyo. This collaboration has boosted the villages' innovative abilities, enabling them to produce products acceptable worldwide. The speaker has seen similar PURA models in other states and suggests that the country needs 7000 such PURA initiatives to bridge the rural-urban divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "The summary needs to capture the key points: employment, self-help groups, land development, sustainable activities, collaboration with JETRO, product development, and the broader vision for PURA across the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should structure the summary to first mention the main initiatives, then the collaboration and its outcomes, and conclude with the vision for the future. Make sure it's concise but covers all important aspects without getting too detailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, I should also ensure that the summary flows well and each sentence connects logically. Maybe start with the economic model, then the land development, followed by the collaboration and product development, and end with the vision of 7000 PURA.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I have a good grasp now. Let me try to put it together.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights initiatives in Periyar PURA villages focused on sustainable economic development. Employment and entrepreneurship are fostered through 1000 self-help groups, transforming 200 acres of wasteland into productive areas for cultivating Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants. Villagers engage in biomass power generation, food processing, and marketing. Collaborations with JETRO and Periyar Maniammai College led to developing 55 internationally competitive lifestyle products, enhancing innovation. The speaker envisions 7000 such PURA models nationwide to bridge rural-urban divides, promoting inclusive growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I've been given a speech to summarize. The speech seems to be about the speaker's experiences with farmers and a disabled individual. Let me start by breaking it down.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, the speaker talks about meeting over 6,000 farmers from different parts of India who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan. These farmers were interested in various gardens like the Mughal, Herbal, Spiritual, Musical, Bio-diesel, and Nutrition Gardens. They also interacted with horticultural specialists. The speaker then mentions addressing agricultural scientists at a symposium called \"Agriculture Cannot Wait.\" Here, they summarized suggestions from farmers about doubling agricultural production with fewer resources and improving the economy through the \"Seed to Food\" principle. They emphasize empowering farmers for a second green revolution and express confidence in increasing agricultural GDP by 4% annually through partnerships.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the speech shifts to an experience on February 24, 2007, in Coimbatore. The speaker met a man named Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, who was born without hands and legs but was very positive. He didn't ask for anything but wanted to sing, which the speaker allowed, and he sang beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the main points are the speaker's interaction with farmers and agricultural scientists focusing on increasing agricultural production and GDP, and an inspiring meeting with a disabled man who, despite his disabilities, was positive and talented.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to condense this into a summary that captures both parts: the agricultural initiatives and the inspiring individual story. I should make sure to highlight the key themes like collaboration between farmers and scientists, the goal of economic improvement, and the positive outlook of the disabled individual.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, the user provided a sample summary. Let me see if I missed anything. The sample summary mentions the meeting with farmers, their interest in various gardens, the symposium, doubling production with reduced resources, the \"Seed to Food\" principle, empowering farmers, GDP growth, and the encounter with Krishna Murthy, highlighting his positivity and his wish to sing.\n",
      "\n",
      "I think I covered all those points. Now, I should structure it clearly, maybe separating the agricultural part and the personal story, but keeping it concise.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two key experiences. First, the speaker discusses their interaction with over 6,000 farmers who visited Rashtrapati Bhavan, showcasing their interest in various gardens and engaging with horticultural experts. The speaker also addressed a symposium, emphasizing the need to double agricultural production with fewer resources, improve the economy through the \"Seed to Food\" principle, and empower farmers for a second green revolution. They expressed confidence in achieving a 4% annual increase in agricultural GDP through collaboration.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, the speaker shares an inspiring encounter with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man born without hands or legs, who despite his disabilities, exuded positivity and a desire to sing, demonstrating resilience and talent. This story underscores the power of a positive outlook.\n",
      "\n",
      "<think>\n",
      "Okay, so I need to help summarize this speech. Let me read through it again to understand the main points.\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech starts with a story about someone who is physically challenged but has a talent for music. He sings a specific song by Saint Thyagaraja, which impresses the speaker. The message here is about overcoming physical challenges through positive attitude and perseverance, supported by parents, teachers, etc. He even performed at the Rashtra Pati Bhavan in 2007.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then the speech shifts to another topic: the recovery efforts in Jammu & Kashmir after the 2005 earthquake. The speaker visited a village called Urusa, adopted by the Air Force for relief. The school was damaged, but the villagers were resilient. They praised the Army, Air Force, and state government for their help. The villagers are seen as overcoming their problems, becoming masters of them rather than being controlled by them.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, the summary should capture both these parts: the musical talent overcoming disability and the community resilience post-earthquake.\n",
      "\n",
      "I need to make sure the summary is concise, covers both main points, and highlights the themes of perseverance and community spirit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me structure it: first part about the musician, his performance, support system, and his inspiration. Second part about the village, the earthquake, support received, and their resilience.\n",
      "\n",
      "I should also ensure that the summary flows well and is not too long.\n",
      "</think>\n",
      "\n",
      "The speech highlights two inspiring narratives of resilience and triumph. The first story features a physically challenged individual who, through determination and support, blossomed into a talented musician, even performing at a prestigious venue. This exemplifies overcoming personal challenges through perseverance. The second part recounts the resilience of a village in Jammu & Kashmir after a devastating earthquake. Despite significant losses, the community, aided by relief efforts, demonstrated remarkable strength and determination, transforming their adversity into mastery. Both tales underscore themes of individual and collective spirit, showcasing how support and resilience can lead to overcoming adversity.\n",

      "The speech starts with a relief operation involving children and villagers. They were brave and smiling, even though they were in temporary tents. The Acting Chief Justice and state authorities were there to help with relief grants for those whose homes were damaged in an earthquake. The speaker mentions experiencing many such courageous acts from citizens during tough times.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the speaker talks about a visit to Car Nicobar Islands in 2005 after the tsunami. They met tribal leaders, students, and children. The tribal islanders took in victims as their own, so there were no orphanages. The speaker was touched and wrote a poem called \"Sea Waves.\" Everyone sang it together, showing courage despite their suffering.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last part mentions addressing the Pan African Parliament in 2004. It was attended by 53 countries, but the summary ends there.\n",

The speaker reflects on the strength shown by citizens during crises. \n",
      "\n",
      "The speech also recounts a visit to Car Nicobar Islands after the 2004 tsunami, where tribal islanders embraced victims as their own, eliminating the need for orphanages. Inspired by their courage, the speaker composed a poem, \"Sea Waves,\" which was sung collectively by the community, showcasing their determination despite suffering. \n",

      "First, the speech mentions that 53 African Union member countries attended, and the speaker proposed this e-Network. It's using satellite, fibre optics, and wireless tech to connect all 53 countries, costing $100 million.\n",
      "\n",
      "Then, the project includes connecting 12 universities—7 from India and 5 from Africa. Also, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals—12 from India and 5 from Africa. Plus, 53 tele-medicine and 53 tele-education centers in Africa.\n",
      "\n",
      "There's a pilot project in Ethiopia for tele-education and tele-medicine. Specifically, IGNOU is offering an MBA course to 34 students from two Ethiopian universities. For tele-medicine, specialists from CARE Hospital are involved.\n",

      "In his farewell speech as President of India, A.P.J. Abdul Kalam expressed gratitude to the nation and reflected on his five-year tenure at Rashtrapati Bhavan. He highlighted ten key messages, including accelerating development driven by youth aspirations, empowering villages, and fostering partnerships to overcome challenges. During his tenure, Kalam visited Nagaland in 2002, witnessing an empowered village council that exemplified effective decision-making and prosperity, emphasizing the need for improved connectivity to enhance village productivity. Additionally, he noted the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women's initiative in creating a PURA complex, which transformed 65 villages by providing urban amenities and fostering economic growth through employment and entrepreneurship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also engaged deeply with agricultural development, meeting over 6,000 farmers and scientists to discuss doubling agricultural production and achieving a 4% annual growth in agricultural GDP, emphasizing the importance of partnerships between farmers, scientists, and industries. His interactions highlighted the nation's potential for a second green revolution, focusing on sustainable practices and value addition.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of his most touching encounters was with Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy, a man born without hands and legs, who inspired Kalam with his optimism and self-sufficiency. Murthy's melodious rendition of Saint Thyagaraja's pancha ratna kriti, \"entharo mahanubavulu,\" showcased his latent talent and positive attitude, encouraged by his parents, teachers, and rasikas. He later performed at the Rashtrapati Bhavan art theatre, exemplifying his desire to inspire others through his art.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also visited Urusa village in Jammu & Kashmir after the devastating 2005 earthquake. Despite severe damage, the villagers, with the support of the Army, Air Force, and state government, demonstrated remarkable resilience. The children of Urusa, despite their losses, showed courage and determination, embodying the spirit of overcoming adversity. This visit reinforced Kalam's belief in the strength and indomitable spirit of the people of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, Kalam championed the Lead India 2020 Foundation, created by Dr. N.B. Sudershan in Hyderabad, which trained thousands of students in Andhra Pradesh. The program had a transformative impact, particularly in Medak district, where students developed self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and a sense of duty toward the nation. Ms. Padma, a student leader from a tribal welfare school in Nalgonda, exemplified this transformation by helping her father quit smoking after participating in the training. This initiative underscored the power of value-based education and leadership in empowering the youth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam emphasized the significance of India's 540 million youth below the age of 25, considering them the most powerful resource for the nation's future. He expressed confidence in their potential when empowered with value-based education and leadership, essential for driving India's progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Internationally, Kalam promoted the Pan African e-Network project, connecting 53 African countries through a seamless network for education and healthcare. This initiative included 12 universities, 17 Super Specialty Hospitals, 53 telemedicine centers, and 53 tele-education centers. The pilot project in Ethiopia, involving institutions like the Indira Gandhi National Open University and CARE Hospital, exemplified his vision for global collaboration. Live tele-consultations between Indian and Ethiopian hospitals demonstrated the practical impact of this initiative, showcasing the potential for cross-border knowledge sharing and medical support.\n",

He concluded by recalling an inspiring question from a young girl about India becoming a developed nation by 2020, encapsulating the aspirations of the youth and reinforcing his vision for India's future.
